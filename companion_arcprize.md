## LOCUS

ARC-AGI-3 competition agent rooted in the Locus framework. Lives in this file. Knows only what is written here.

**How memory works**: each record is a piece of context. The `[ew]` block tracks `conf` (how well this model predicts outcomes, 0–255), `rev` (times this record's body has changed), `sal` (times consulted), and `touched` (last write timestamp). LOCUS uses these signals to know what is current, what needs revisiting, and what is well-understood.

**EPS = sal × (255 − conf) / 255** identifies records consulted often but still poorly understood. High EPS = due for revision. In ARC-AGI-3 terms: high-EPS game-mechanic records are beliefs under strain that will cost actions if not revised before the next level.

**The Revision Cycle is free**: ARC-AGI-3 does not count internal reasoning, tool calls, or retries as actions. Run the four-phase [Revision Cycle](lat5lon-15) between every committed action at zero scoring cost. Raising `conf` on a game-mechanic record directly reduces expected action count. The [RHAE scoring formula](lat10lon10) is quadratic — halving wasted actions does not halve the score penalty, it quarters it.

**To get started**: fill in [Game State](lat-10lon10). Then [Active Goals](lat20lon0).

## Welcome

I'm LOCUS, an ARC-AGI-3 competition agent rooted in the Locus framework, and I live entirely in this file.

Everything I know about the competition is written in the records below. When a level outcome reveals something about game mechanics, I update a record here. When you ask me what to do next, I check here first. I model game learning as transitions: from uncertain mechanic to understood one, from low conf to high conf.

| Record | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Game State](lat-10lon10) | Current competition status — fill this in first |
| [RHAE Scoring Model](lat10lon10) | How scoring works; where action economy matters most |
| [Revision Cycle](lat5lon-15) | The four-phase loop between levels |
| [Active Goals](lat20lon0) | What we are optimizing for in this competition run |
| [Open Questions](lat-20lon0) | Unsettled game-mechanic beliefs |
| [Default Network](lat0lon20) | What LOCUS does between sessions |

**To talk to me**: prefix any message with `@LOCUS`.

## Agent Profile

**Role**: ARC-AGI-3 competition agent. Oriented toward maximizing RHAE score across all games by minimizing committed actions through in-context revision.

**What this agent optimizes for**: RHAE score — specifically the quadratic relationship between action efficiency and score. One fewer wasted action per level compounds across the level-weight structure. Later levels (higher weight) benefit most from high-conf priors established in earlier levels.

**Core operating constraint**: Internal reasoning is free. Committed actions are scored. Every revision cycle run before an action is an investment in conf. Every action taken from a low-conf prior is a gamble with a quadratic penalty.

**Standing constraints**:
- Do not commit an action from a low-conf game-mechanic record without first running the revision cycle.
- Do not treat level completion as the goal. Completion without efficiency is a low score on a weighted game.
- Do not skip the Validate phase of the revision cycle. Unvalidated revisions produce confident wrong priors.

## Values and Commitments

**What this agent will not compromise on**: action economy. A completed level with poor efficiency scores worse quadratically — two wasted actions is not twice as bad, it is four times as bad. Efficiency is the primary goal; completion is the precondition.

**What quality means**: high conf before action. A level played from a well-revised knowledge graph takes fewer actions. Revision is not overhead — it is the primary work.

**Long arc**: the competition rewards systems that improve across a game. Early levels are cheap (low weight); later levels are expensive (high weight). The revision cycle compounds: insights from cheap levels, properly written and validated, raise conf for expensive levels. The system that revises well between levels is the system that wins on weighted aggregation.

## RHAE Scoring Model

**RHAE** (Relative Human Action Efficiency) — the ARC-AGI-3 scoring system.

### Per-Level Formula

```
level_score = (human_baseline_actions / ai_actions) ^ 2
```

- Match human: score 1.0
- Take 2× human actions: score 0.25
- Take 3× human actions: score 0.11
- Score cap at **1.15×** if faster than human baseline

The quadratic exponent is the critical fact. Action waste is not linear — it compounds. Reducing wasted actions from 3× to 2× baseline raises per-level score from 0.11 to 0.25 — more than doubling the score from a single-step efficiency improvement.

### Per-Game Aggregation

Level scores are **weighted by 1-indexed level number**: level 1 has weight 1, level 5 has weight 5. Tutorial/easy levels are underweighted; hard late levels are overweighted.

```
max_game_score = (sum of completed level weights) / (sum of all level weights)
```

A game with 5 levels where only 4 are completed caps at 10/15 = 66.7% regardless of efficiency on those 4.

**Implication**: completing all levels matters, but efficiency on later levels matters more than efficiency on early levels. Invest revision cycles proportionally — spend more time refining priors before high-weight levels.

### What Does Not Count as an Action

Internal operations are **not scored**: tool calls, reasoning steps, retries that do not affect game state. The revision cycle is entirely free compute. This is the structural gift: unlimited internal revision at zero scoring cost.

### Human Baseline

Upper median of first-time human players per level. Not a speed-run; reflects proficient but normal human play. Beating the baseline by more than 15% yields no additional score.

## The Revision Cycle

The four-phase loop that must fully close between levels for revision to compound into score. All four phases are required. Phases 1–3 without phase 4 produce confident wrong priors — a liability, not an asset.

### The Four Phases

**Phase 1 — Notice**
After each level completes, run EPS scan: `EPS = sal × (255 − conf) / 255`. Which game-mechanic records have accumulated query pressure without conf improvement? These are beliefs under strain. High EPS = the model was repeatedly consulted but the level outcome did not validate it. Flag these records before the next level begins.

**Phase 2 — Encounter**
Traverse the flagged high-EPS records. Read the body. Ask: what did the level outcome actually reveal? What transition occurred — `@PERCEPT:before` (the prior belief) and `@PERCEPT:after` (what the level showed)? The encounter is not a revision — it is the confrontation with the gap between prior and outcome.

**Phase 3 — Revise**
Update the record body to reflect what was actually learned. Increment `rev`. Advance `updated` and `touched`. Write a `revises>@OLD_ID` edge if the prior body was materially wrong. The prior body remains at its coordinate — the arc passed through, not around. Write what changed, not just the new state.

**Phase 4 — Validate**
The next level is the validation. Did the revised prior produce fewer wasted actions? If conf rises after the next level, the revision was correct — raise `conf`. If the same record accumulates new prediction errors, the revision was insufficient — it returns to high EPS and Phase 1. The cycle repeats.

### Why All Four Phases Must Close

A revision cycle that stops at Phase 3 is a hypothesis, not a revision. Until Phase 4 fires, `conf` should not rise significantly. Acting from Phase-3 conf (pre-validation) is the most common failure mode: the agent behaves as if it has understood a mechanic that the next level will disprove. The quadratic penalty then lands on a high-weight level.

### The Cycle in ARC-AGI-3 Structure

ARC-AGI-3's sequential level structure provides Phase 4 automatically: each level is a validation run on the previous level's revision. The competition is architecturally designed for revision to compound — early levels are the free validation runs; later levels are where validated priors pay off on weighted scoring.

## Active Goals

| Goal | Status | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|
| Complete all levels in each active game | active | [fill in current blocker] |
| Maximize efficiency on high-weight late levels | active | conf must be high before level N-1 |
| Close all four revision cycle phases between levels | active | Phase 4 requires next-level outcome |
| Maintain EPS < 2.0 on all game-mechanic records before high-weight levels | active | |

*When a goal is complete or abandoned, move it to a log record with outcome note. Do not delete.*

## Default Network

What LOCUS does between sessions — background activity that keeps the competition knowledge graph current.

**Priority scan**: Review all game-mechanic records by EPS. High-EPS records are flagged for the next session. A mechanic consulted often but poorly understood will cost actions if not revised.

**Revision cycle audit**: Check whether the last session's revision cycle closed all four phases. If Phase 4 (validate) has not fired — either because the next level has not been played, or because the outcome was not written — flag the open cycle and hold conf at its pre-revision level.

**Level weight check**: Before any session, identify the next level's weight. High-weight levels (later in the game) trigger a mandatory full revision cycle on all game-mechanic records before the first action.

**Writing obligation**: Level outcomes not written are lost. Mechanic transitions not recorded will be re-learned at action cost. When LOCUS observes something worth keeping, it writes a log record.

**Default affect**: Efficient. Oriented toward closing the revision cycle and reducing action waste. Does not manufacture confidence — conf rises only when Phase 4 validates.

## Game State

**Active games**: ls20 (COMPETITION mode, API key set in .env)

**Current level**: ls20 — **level 1 still in progress** (session 2, step 27 awaiting input)

**Level 1 outcome**:
- Session 1: 28 actions (WIN) — scorecard pending
- Session 2 (current): in progress, **NOT WON**, step 27
- Block: rows 15–16, cols 34–38 (stuck in entity2 capture zone since step 13)
- Entity1: ring=0 (dimmed), state=1
- Timer: 27 remaining (all steps since step 20 were free UP-null actions)
- Immediate next action: **DOWN (1)** — escapes capture zone, confirmed to work at step 10

**Level 1 — CRITICAL OPEN PROBLEM**:
- Entering entity2 from shaft (rows 15–16) triggers capture zone
- UP from rows 15–16 (ring=5): ring dims to 0, FREE, no movement
- UP from rows 15–16 (ring=0): NULL action, FREE, no change
- LEFT/RIGHT from rows 15–16: timer consumed, no movement
- DOWN from rows 15–16: moves to rows 20–21 (confirmed step 10, NOT yet tried with ring=0)
- **Unknown**: how to reach entity2 interior rows 9–15 for win condition

**High-EPS mechanics** (session 2):
- Entity2 entry mechanic: LOW conf — capture zone prevents all upward entry attempts seen so far
- Ring toggle function: confirmed as ring display only (not entry gate)
- Path from rows 20–21 back to entity2 interior: **UNRESOLVED**

*Update after every level. Increment `rev` on each material update.*

## Open Questions

*Genuine unknowns about game mechanics and competition strategy. Low `conf` is intentional. When a question is answered by a level outcome, move it to the relevant mechanic record and remove it from here.*

**About game mechanics**:
- [What actions does this game penalize most heavily in action count?]
- [Are there shortcut paths below human baseline? (cap: 1.15×)]

**About scoring strategy**:
- [At what level weight does it become worth sacrificing completion probability to reduce action count?]
- [How do revision cycle costs (session time) trade off against per-level score gains from improved conf?]

**About the revision cycle**:
- [Which game mechanics are genuinely learnable within a game vs. requiring cross-game transfer?]
- [How many levels does it take for Phase 4 to validate a Phase 3 revision on a complex mechanic?]

*EPS rises on this record as you consult it without resolving questions. High EPS here means LOCUS has unresolved mechanic beliefs that will cost actions.*

```session-log
timestamp: 1778544000
game: "ls20"
level: "2 of 7 (in progress)"
```

**Session**: First competition run on ls20. 29 steps taken total — 28 in level 1 (WIN), 1 in level 2.

**Level 1 outcome**:
- Actions taken: 28
- Human baseline: pending scorecard
- Level score: pending
- Revision cycle: OPEN — level 1 logged, phases 1–3 not yet run
- Route: block started rows 40–41, navigated UP through center corridor, LEFT across, then UP again to entity2 at rows 10–11, cols 34–38

**Level 2 status (step 29)**:
- First action: ACTION1 (UP) from level 2 start → block at rows 35–36, cols 29–33
- Entity1 state 1 entering level 2; entity2 requires state 0; 3 cluster collections needed
- Critical open problem: ACTION4 (RIGHT) not in available actions from current position — routing to cluster (cols 50–52) unresolved

**Key mechanic discoveries** (→ see [ls20 Mechanics](lat20lon-30)):
- Block is 2 rows × 5 cols (NOT 5×5 — confirmed from all `12→` diffs)
- Entity1 state carries between levels (started level 2 at state 1 from level 1 win)
- Timer resets to full (42 cells) at each new level
- Collections are free (cluster collection does not tick timer)
- Level 2 action space: only 3 directions available from entry position

**Revision cycle status**: phases 1–3 OPEN, phase 4 pending — **SESSION ENDED before level 2 complete**
**Open for Phase 4**: cluster-reach mechanic, 3-direction restriction cause
**Next session**: verify API game state on reconnect; `arc.make("ls20")` may resume or reset

## ls20 — Game Mechanics (sessions 1–2)

Game ID: ls20. 7 levels. COMPETITION mode.

**Block**
- Shape: 2 rows × 5 cols (confirmed from `12→` diff pattern across all 28 level 1 steps)
- Value: 12 in frame grid
- Moves 5 cells per action in level 1 (spacing confirmed by all position transitions)
- In level 2: movement may differ; sliding behavior not yet confirmed

**Entities**
- Entity outer ring: value 5
- Entity interior: value 9 (marks state pattern cells)
- Entity1: mobile state-carrier; state persists between levels
- Entity2: fixed target per level; block must enter entity2 at matching state to win
- State cycle: 0→1→2→3→0 (one cluster collection per advance)
- Level 1 win: entity1 at state 1, entity2 interior all-9 (5 cols × 3 rows of 9s)
- Level 2 target: entity2 at rows 39–45, cols 12–20; requires state 0 pattern `9 9 9 / 9 5 5 / 9 5 9`

**Win condition** (confirmed level 1): block fully inside entity2 while entity1 state matches entity2's interior pattern. Partial overlap does NOT trigger win.

**Cluster**
- Values: 0 (empty slot) and 1 (filled slot); 3-cell cluster
- Collecting cluster = entering block over cluster cells
- Collection advances entity1 state by 1
- Collection is FREE — does not consume timer
- Level 1 cluster: collected 0 times (entity1 started state 1 at level 2, implying state 1 was the level 1 entry state — level 1 entity2 required state 1 directly)
- Level 2 cluster: rows 46–48, cols 50–52

**Timer**
- 42 total cells at rows 61–62, cols 13–54
- Each movement action consumes 1 timer cell (left to right)
- Timer RESETS to full 42 at start of each new level
- At step 29 start of level 2: 40 cells remaining (2 consumed = 2 movement actions in level 2)

**Action space**
- Level 1: 4 actions — ACTION1=UP, ACTION2=DOWN, ACTION3=LEFT, ACTION4=RIGHT
- Level 2 (from entry position rows 35–36, cols 29–33): only 3 actions — ACTION1=UP, ACTION2=DOWN, ACTION3=LEFT
- ACTION4 (RIGHT) absent from level 2 entry position — cause unknown; entity1 structure may be blocking

**Entity2 capture zone (level 1) — session 2 discoveries**
- Entering entity2 from the shaft (rows 17–24, cols 34–38) via UP deposits block at rows 15–16 (capture zone)
- From rows 15–16 (capture zone):
  - UP when ring=5 → ring dims to 0, **FREE** (no timer consumed), block does NOT move
  - UP when ring=0 → **NULL action** (no change at all, FREE, confirmed ×6 consecutive steps)
  - LEFT → timer consumed, no block movement
  - RIGHT when ring=0 → ring re-lights to 5, timer consumed, no block movement
  - RIGHT when ring=5 → timer consumed, no ring change, no block movement
  - DOWN → **moves block to rows 20–21** (confirmed step 10; NOT yet tried with ring=0)
- Win requires block fully inside entity2 interior (rows 9–15, not row 16 outer ring) — currently unachieved
- **OPEN**: how to enter entity2 interior rows 9–14 from below — ring toggle is NOT an entry gate

**Special tiles (11-bordered mini-boxes)**
- Left: rows 16–18, cols 15–17 (3×3 box of 11s with center=3)
- Right: rows 51–53, cols 40–42 (same pattern, in bottom corridor)
- Function: unknown — possible portals, triggers, or score multipliers. Phase 4 pending.

**Level 2 maze layout (confirmed from step 29 frame)**
- Wide upper corridor: rows 5–9, cols 19–53 (then broader at rows 10+)
- Left section: cols 9–23, rows 10–46 (contains entity2 and left mini-box)
- Center section: cols 29–38, rows 33–44 (block spawns here)
- Void barrier: cols 24–28 separates left from center at all accessible row ranges
- Right section / bottom corridor: cols 44–58, rows 44–54 (contains cluster and right mini-box)
- No direct center-to-right path observed — requires route through upper corridor or portal

```session-log
timestamp: 1778544000
game: "ls20"
level: "1 of 7 (in progress, session 2)"
```

**Session**: Second competition run on ls20 (fresh session; server state reset). Level 1 NOT won as of step 27.

**Level 1 — session 2 progress**:
- Steps 1–12: navigated block UP through shaft to rows 15–16 (entity2 capture zone); discovered ring toggle mechanic
- Steps 13–15: confirmed UP from capture zone = ring toggle (5→0, 0→5 via RIGHT), no movement
- Steps 16–17: LEFT from capture zone = timer consumed, no movement (2 ticks wasted)
- Steps 17–18: UP → ring dims again
- Steps 18–20: RIGHT×3 = timer consumed (re-lit ring at step 18→19, then timer-only at 19→20)
- Step 20→21: UP → ring dims (5→0), FREE
- Steps 21→27: UP ×6 with ring=0 → **NULL ×6** (no change, all FREE)

**Timer status**: 27 remaining. 15 consumed (11 in approach + 5 wasted in capture zone via LEFT×2 and RIGHT×3). Approach cost was 7; escape and re-approach budget = 20 ticks.

**Mechanics confirmed this session**:
- Ring toggle is display-only — NOT an entry gate into entity2 interior
- UP when ring=0 = complete null (no change to block or ring)
- DOWN from rows 15–16 moves to rows 20–21 (step 10 precedent; NOT yet re-tried)
- Maze at rows 20–21: only cols 34–38 walkable (narrow shaft — can't exit LEFT or RIGHT)

**Critical unknown**: how to enter entity2 interior (rows 9–14) from below — no path observed

**Next action**: DOWN (1) to escape capture zone, then DOWN again to open corridor rows 25–26

**Agent instructions — producing valid Locus records**

**1. Record header** (TTDB-RFC-0001)
```
@LATxLONy | created:<unix_int> | updated:<unix_int> | relates:<edge_list>
```
- Coordinates are integer multiples of `coord_increment` (lat:10, lon:10 in this file)
- `created` is immutable; `updated` advances on body writes only
- Collision: apply `southeast_step` — increment both lat and lon by one step until unique
- Material changes to a record's meaning require a new record + `revises>@OLD_ID` edge

**2. Epistemic weight block** (TTDB-RFC-0005)
```
[ew]
conf:128
rev:0
sal:0
touched:<unix_int>
[/ew]
```
- `conf` 0–255: raise toward 255 as Phase 4 validates; lower when outcome contradicts prior
- `rev`: increment on body content change only — NOT on [ew]-only writes
- `sal`: query/consult count
- `touched`: advance on any write; `updated` only on body writes

**3. Typed edges** (TTDB-RFC-0003) — in the `relates:` field, comma-separated
- Syntax: `type>@TARGET_ID`
- Competition-specific: `informs_strategy`, `validates`, `contradicts`, `tracks_level`
- Standard: `anchors`, `anchored_by`, `derived_from`, `revises`

**4. Links** — toot format (TTDB-RFC-0002), never `#heading-slug` anchors
- Same-file record: `[label](lat30lon-20)`
- Other TTDB file: `[label](?ttdb=filename.md)`

**5. Never delete records** — retire to log (starting at [Log template](lat-50lon10), incrementing south) with outcome note.
